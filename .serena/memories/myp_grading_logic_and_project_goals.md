## IB MYP Grading & Analytics Goals

1. **The Core Grading Logic: The 0–8 Scale**

The Middle Years Programme (MYP) does not use percentages. Instead, it measures specific skills called Criteria.

- There are four criteria (A, B, C, and D) for every subject.
- Each criterion is scored from 0 to 8.
- **Key Concept:** A score of 4/8 is not "50% (Failing)." It represents a "Satisfactory" level of achievement. A 7 or 8 represents "Exceptional" mastery.

2. **How Final Grades are Calculated (The 1–7 Scale)**

At the end of a term, a student's performance is distilled into a single grade from 1 (Lowest) to 7 (Highest).

- **Summing:** The "latest/best" scores for Criteria A, B, C, and D are added together. (Maximum possible sum = 32).

- **Boundary Mapping:** That sum is converted into a 1–7 grade using this fixed IB table:

| Total Score (A+B+C+D) | Final IB Grade   |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| 28 – 32               | 7 (Excellent)    |
| 24 – 27               | 6 (Very Good)    |
| 19 – 23               | 5 (Good)         |
| 15 – 18               | 4 (Satisfactory) |
| 10 – 14               | 3 (Mediocre)     |
| 6 – 9                 | 2 (Poor)         |
| 1 – 5                 | 1 (Very Poor)    |

3. **Subject-Specific Context**

While every subject uses A, B, C, and D, what those letters stand for changes. For example:

- **Mathematics:** A is "Knowledge," B is "Investigating Patterns," C is "Communication," D is "Real-life Application."

- **Arts:** A is "Investigating," B is "Developing," C is "Creating," D is "Evaluating."

- **Note:** The analytics platform must distinguish between "Math Criterion A" and "Arts Criterion A." They are not interchangeable.

4. **Project Goals: Analytics & Intervention**

The primary goal of this platform is to provide "Early Warning" signals that traditional gradebooks miss.

- **Flagging At-Risk Students:** * Low Achievement: Flag students with a 1, 2, or 3 in any final grade.
    - The "Spiky Profile": Flag students who have a high score in one criterion (e.g., an 8 in Math Knowledge) but a very low score in another (e.g., a 2 in Math Communication). This indicates a specific skill gap.
    - Downward Trends: Identify students whose scores are dropping over time across different units.

- Trend Visualization:
    - Users need to see if a whole class is struggling with "Criterion D" (Evaluation) across all subjects. This helps the school decide if they need to teach critical thinking skills more effectively.

- Filtering & Comparison:
    - Compare performance between different groups (e.g., Grade 9 vs. Grade 10) or specific demographics to ensure equity in learning.
