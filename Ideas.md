## 1. Core Objectives of the System

Before metrics, anchor the system around decisions it enables:

-   Early identification of at-risk students
    
-   Monitoring academic progress at student, class, cohort, and school levels
    
-   Evaluating instructional effectiveness
    
-   Supporting targeted interventions
    
-   Providing transparency to leadership, teachers, counselors, and (optionally) parents
    

----------

## 2. Key Stakeholders & Dashboard Views

Different users need different abstractions:

### A. School Leadership (Principal, Admin)

-   High-level trends and comparisons
    
-   Cohort performance and equity analysis
    
-   Teacher/course effectiveness indicators
    

### B. Teachers

-   Class-level and student-level insights
    
-   Diagnostic breakdowns by skill/standard
    
-   Actionable recommendations
    

### C. Counselors / Support Staff

-   Risk flags and intervention tracking
    
-   Holistic student profiles
    

### D. Students / Parents (Optional, Simplified)

-   Progress tracking
    
-   Goal-oriented feedback
    
-   Strengths and growth areas
    

----------

## 3. Student Performance Metrics (Core)

### A. Academic Achievement

-   Current grade / GPA (weighted and unweighted)
    
-   Grade trajectory (trend over time)
    
-   Assessment scores (quizzes, tests, standardized exams)
    
-   Mastery by subject, topic, or learning standard
    

### B. Growth & Progress

-   Year-over-year or term-over-term growth
    
-   Expected vs. actual progress (value-added)
    
-   Percentile rank within class, grade, or school
    
-   Improvement velocity (rate of change)
    

### C. Consistency & Stability

-   Grade volatility (high swings vs. steady performance)
    
-   Missing or late assignment frequency
    
-   Performance divergence across subjects
    

----------

## 4. Engagement & Behavior Signals (Leading Indicators)

These often predict academic outcomes:

### A. Attendance

-   Attendance rate
    
-   Chronic absenteeism flag
    
-   Attendance trend
    

### B. Participation & Effort

-   Assignment completion rate
    
-   On-time submission rate
    
-   Class participation (if measurable)
    
-   LMS activity (logins, time-on-task, content views)
    

### C. Behavioral Indicators (if applicable)

-   Behavior incidents count/severity
    
-   Positive behavior recognition
    
-   Trend over time
    

----------

## 5. Risk & Early Warning Indicators

Combine multiple signals into interpretable flags:

-   Academic risk score (composite index)
    
-   Engagement risk score
    
-   Sudden performance drops
    
-   “Silent failure” detection (attendance OK, grades slipping)
    
-   Threshold-based alerts (e.g., GPA < X, missing > Y assignments)
    

Visual concept:

-   Traffic light indicators (Green / Yellow / Red)
    
-   Confidence bands or risk probability
    

----------

## 6. Diagnostic & Drill-Down Analytics

### A. Skill / Standard Mastery

-   Heatmaps of mastery by standard
    
-   Gaps by prerequisite skills
    
-   Cross-subject correlations (e.g., reading vs. science)
    

### B. Question-Level Analysis (Assessments)

-   Common wrong answers
    
-   Item difficulty and discrimination
    
-   Misconception clustering
    

### C. Subgroup Analysis

-   Performance by demographic attributes (carefully governed)
    
-   Program participation (e.g., ESL, special education)
    
-   Equity gap tracking over time
    

----------

## 7. Comparative & Benchmarking Views

-   Student vs. class / grade / school average
    
-   Class vs. grade vs. historical cohorts
    
-   Teacher/course section comparisons
    
-   Internal benchmarks vs. external standards (if available)
    

----------

## 8. Intervention & Action Tracking

Turn insights into action:

-   Logged interventions (tutoring, counseling, accommodations)
    
-   Intervention start/end dates
    
-   Pre/post impact analysis
    
-   Notes and qualitative observations
    
-   Ownership and follow-up reminders
    

----------

## 9. Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics (Advanced)

If data maturity allows:

-   Grade or exam outcome predictions
    
-   Dropout or course failure probability
    
-   “What-if” scenarios (e.g., improved attendance)
    
-   Recommended interventions based on similar students
    

----------

## 10. UX & Visualization Concepts

Effective patterns for schools:

-   Student profile page (360° view)
    
-   Time-series line charts for progress
    
-   Heatmaps for mastery and risk
    
-   Sparklines next to names in tables
    
-   Filters: term, subject, teacher, cohort
    
-   Explainability tooltips (why a student is flagged)
    

----------

## 11. Data Governance & Trust Considerations

Critical for adoption:

-   Clear metric definitions
    
-   Role-based access control
    
-   Bias-aware modeling and disclaimers
    
-   Audit logs for data changes
    
-   Ability to annotate or override system flags
    

----------

## 12. Example “North Star” Questions the Dashboard Answers

-   Which students need help _now_?
    
-   Are interventions working?
    
-   Where are learning gaps emerging across cohorts?
    
-   Which courses or standards are underperforming?
    
-   Are performance gaps narrowing or widening?
    

----------

## 13. Possible MVP vs. Phase 2

**MVP**

-   Grades, attendance, assignment completion
    
-   Risk flags
    
-   Student and class views
    

**Phase 2**

-   Mastery analytics
    
-   Predictive models
    
-   Intervention impact measurement
    
-   Parent/student portals
